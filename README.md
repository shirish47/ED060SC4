# ED060SC4
some testing code, nothing is working (sample ported from EssentialScrap driver code)
1) Nothing is working
2) All Logic files are signals generated by programming controller and it is not working.
3) We are making sure things work. 


We are making a module that will help people easily implement this EPD Devices. We will probably not going to open source the project as we are building it from scratch and for our own use.
But we are developing a controller based solution. 
Easy to implement in other projects in a module form.

Stay tunned.
